Making dropping out and following your favorite bands around the country easier than ever.

groopy’s design is to allow the user to search for their favorite bands in order to find out some basic info and that band’s tour dates.

Users can carry out a search by entering the name of their desired band into the search bar and pressing the search button on the page or the enter button.  The search will pull up a band image, bio, top tracks, and tour dates as long as the information is available.

User’s can also save bands they like in order to allow for easier searching in the future.

Upcoming versions have been planned with the intent to add:

- new artist suggestion
- creation of user profiles
- personalized saved band list instead of pulling from all user entries
- user ability to track shows
- reminders for tracked shows when’d the date is approaching
- message boards for shows to allow user communication prior to show dates
- streaming capability (if copyright laws allow it)
